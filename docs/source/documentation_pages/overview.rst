Overview over LigandParametrization
====================================

*LigandParameterization* is a python package that provides a simple interface for parameterizing non-standard residues 
for use in molecular dynamics simulations using the AMBER force field. The package is designed to be easily extensible,
and is built around a series of stages that can be easily added or removed from a parametrization pipeline. 

The package is designed to be used in a modular fashion, with a set of pre-defined recipes that can be used to 
parametrize a ligand with a single command. More on these recipes can be found in the :doc:`recipes` section of the documentation.
